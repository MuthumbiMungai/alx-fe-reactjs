# ALX FE ReactJS – Fundamentals and Core Concepts of React

This project is part of the **ALX Frontend ReactJS** curriculum.  
It introduces the essential elements of **React**, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  
By engaging with this project, I learned how to set up a React application, work with JSX, create reusable components, manage props and state, and assemble a complete React app.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Understand what React JS is and why it is valuable for web development.
- Learn how to set up and run a React project using **Vite**.
- Get familiar with **ReactDOM** and **JSX**.
- Create and reuse **React components**.
- Pass and use **props** in components.
- Manage **state** using the `useState` hook.
- Integrate multiple components into one main application.
